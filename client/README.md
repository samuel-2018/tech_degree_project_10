# CLIENT: Full Stack App with React and a REST API (Tech Degree)

## Description

The client side of this application displays a simple, responsive design.

The main page shows a list of all the courses retrieved from the REST API. Users can click on a course to view details.

After creating an account or signing in, the user can also upload courses. The “course description” and “materials needed” portions accept markdown formatting. Modifying or deleting a course is restricted to the owner of the course.

Once a user has signed in, the user’s credentials are stored in the browser’s session as well as in an HTTP cookie. This allows the user’s authentication to persist even after closing and reopening the browser. Clicking the sign out button removes the user’s credentials from the active session and deletes the cookie.

Technologies used in this project include React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, React Markdown, Create React App, and Axios.

(The project’s CSS file was adapted from the file supplied for this project. The example HTML markup files were referenced when creating the React templates.)

## "Extra Credit" Features

- Routes and stateless functional components for displaying: “Not Found”, “Forbidden”, and, for unhandled errors, “Error”.

- HTTP cookie for persisting user credentials.

- Redirect for when a user successfully signs in after trying to view a protected route.

# Create React App Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
